      <h4><span class="text_color">MICROPAYMENTS</span>: An Ethical Investigation</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="introduction-text">
      <p>Micropayments have existed as an idea since the mid-1990’s and, given widespread adoption, could change the paradigm of e-commerce. Micropayments are small fees, ranging from fractions of a cent to several dollars, which allow consumers to access a service without paying a flat subscription-based fee. Micropayments are appealing because they allow consumers to spend as they use a service, benefiting corporations and customers alike. Despite their theoretical benefits, micropayments have yet to see mainstream use.</p>

      <p>Micropayments are hampered by the relatively high cost of implementation. A traditional payment scheme can pay several cents to service a $5 transaction with plenty of profit left over. In the case of micropayments, the service charge often eclipses the actual payment. Additionally, a viable system of micropayments requires a much smoother process than traditional payment schemes, since customers won’t want to submit financial details whenever they read a newspaper. At the same time, however, micropayments need to keep financial data secure and charge users across multiple services seamlessly.</p>

      <p>Micropayments could also be a double-edged sword for privacy concerns. If websites could charge users a small fee per visit to remain profitable rather than charging advertises, it would give consumers an option to functionally buy back their privacy. Conversely, micropayments would leave yet another trail of internet usage and financial transactions. If micropayment providers don’t act ethically with this data, it could make privacy concerns even worse.</p>

      <p>By looking at both the economic and social issues associated with micropayments, we aim to show that micropayments are not the silver bullet solution for charging for services online.</p>

          <p>Since the launch of iTunes in 2003, Apple’s adoption of micropayments has contrasted with the lack of successors, leaving many wondering why micropayments have not become more ubiquitous. There are several <a href="#issues" style="display: inline">key issues</a> with the implementation of micropayments, but their immense potential has led to an entire industry willing to experiment with different solutions.

Micropayments cause friction on two fronts, consumers and producers. For consumers, there is a psychological hurdle associated with online payments  - digital purchasing is already challenging for many, and the frequency of micropayments can worsen the obstacle. For producers, the fees inherent to online payments are tolerable only in a system where they’re significantly outweighed by profits; micropayments limit the potential profit of an online transaction because of the inherent cost of doing business online.

The existent commercial solutions aim to address these solutions in very different ways. Three main schools of thought have been applied to this conundrum: pay-as-you-go, prepaid systems, and billing aggregation. These systems are not mutually exclusive, and examples will be provided for the implementation of each.</p>
			
		  <br/>
          <h3><b>Pay-As-You-Go</h3></b>

          <hr/>

          <p>Pay-As-You-Go systems do exactly what they say on the tin. Consumers navigate the web and pay for content immediately on individual items. This system is how consumers usually conceptualize micropayments, but is a bit of a rarity in actual implementation.

For customers, the main benefit is the intuitive nature of charges. For this reason, pay-as-you-go systems are psychologically easy to conceptualize and adopt.

For the same reasons, pay-as-you-go systems are almost impossible for producers to implement. The high number of transactions lead to a high number of transaction fees, ensuring that a higher ratio of each purchase pays for the facilitation of that purchase. Obviously this results in less money for the producers, higher costs for the consumer, and nearly defeats the point of micropayments.

Pay-as-you-go systems have seen widespread adoption for platforms such as iTunes, Android Pay, and an uncountable number of video games. The problem of transaction fees manifest as higher costs for consumers - the minimum cost for consumers usually hovers around 99 cents.</p>

          <p><b>Advantages</p></b>
          <ul>
          	<li>Easy for customers to conceptualize and adopt; encourages spending.</li>
          	<li>Feasible for producers who are willing to charge more for their product</li>
          </ul>

          <p><b>Disadvantages</p></b>
          <ul>
          	<li>More transactions result in more transaction fees, often raising the price that producers have to charge.</li>
          	<li>These systems are often platform specific, meaning that consumers have to entrust multiple vendors with their payment info.</li>
          </ul>


          <br/>
          <h3><b>Prepaid Systems</h3></b>

          <hr/>

          <p>People participate in prepaid systems when they buy a gift card, digital currency in games, or put funds into an online wallet. Most consumers, by design, don’t realize that they’ve paid into micropayment systems in this way.

In a prepay system, consumers convert a set amount of their funds into digital currency that can be spent at the consumer’s discretion. This conversion can occur online, or by purchasing gift cards at physical stores. The digital currencies are almost always bound to a specific vendor.

By doing the transaction up-front, vendors minimize the number of transactions and ensure that payment has been received for the goods and services rendered. Consumers often don’t realize that they’ve paid into a system of micropayments, and feel comfortable making these types of transactions.

Prepay systems can easily be abused by vendors, however. For example, let’s say that a consumer purchases 2,000 gems from a company.  That company then prices their product at 300 gems per transaction, ensuring that the consumer will have remaining funds when they’ve spent as much as possible with their first transaction. Additionally, if 2,000 gems cost $5, producers can charge $10 for 5,000 gems, providing more value for more money with nonlinear pricing. These practices subtly increase the customer’s chances to buy more  of the digital currency, but often result in fatigue for the consumers who see through the schemes.</p>

          <p><b>Advantages</p></b>
          <ul>
          	<li>The large up-front costs make transaction fees worthwhile for producers. This difference can make micropayments possible for producers.</li>
          	<li>Consumers can deal with the consumer on their own footing, choosing how much to add to their digital wallet.</li>
          	<li>Consumers can buy currency with cash.</li>
          	<li>Provides unique options for both parties. Consumers can have recurring payments and effectively set a stipend for themselves. Producers can price things in ways that encourage more spending.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><b>Disadvantages</p></b>
          <ul>
          	<li>Removes the freedom of micropayment systems in pay-as-you-go schemes.</li>
			<li>Often makes more sense for subscription models; not mutually inclusive with micropayments.</li>
			<li>Digital currencies are often proprietary, and result in a fractured experience for consumers who must pay for individual sites.</li>
			<li>Predatory business practices can cause fatigue for consumers.</li>
	      </ul>

	       <br/>
          <h3><b>Payment Aggregation</h3></b>

          <hr/>

          <p>Payment aggregation systems often track purchases over multiple platforms to combine things into one lump-sum payment. From the consumer’s perspective, they go from site to site, spending small amounts to access the content from each producer. If they read four articles from The Atlantic and watch three videos by Vox, they’ll be charged for the seven products at the end of the week.

Although not mutually inclusive to payment aggregation, there is a greater emphasis on networking transactions between companies. This almost always requires a third party to collect purchase histories from companies so that one fee can be applied to a consumer at the end of a payment period. This is often known as postpay, but that name implies a mutual exclusivity with prepay systems that doesn’t exist.</p>

          <p><b>Advantages</p></b>
          <ul>
          	<li>Preserves the à la carte experience intended by micropayment systems; users only buy exactly what they consume.</li>
          	<li>Consumers don’t need to pay an upfront cost to access content.</li>
          	<li>Producers don’t need to pay an excessive number of transaction costs, even if they still lose money (or make very little profits) on low-volume consumers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><b>Disadvantages</p></b>
          <ul>
			<li>Often requires third parties to facilitate, often resulting in additional transaction fees.</li>
			<li>If users don’t purchase a certain amount of content, the vendor may not make their fees back.</li>
			<li>Very similar to a subscription model; might not offer more value to consumers than a subscription model.</li>
	      </ul>

  	      <br/>
          <h3><b>Examples</h3></b>

          <hr/>
          <p><b>iTunes</p></b>

          <p>Apple has found a way to elegantly combine prepaid systems with payment aggregation, resulting in a widespread success. Users can buy gift cards or purchase songs directly from their debit/credit cards. In either case, Apple waits a day or two for additional purchases before actually charging users. Payment feels immediate for consumers, and the number of transactions is reduced for the company. The marginal value of this system has proven to be powerful.</p>

		  <br/>
          <p><b>PayPal</p></b>

          <p>PayPal exemplifies payment aggregation and pay-as-you-go systems. Users will deposit currency at a 1:1 ratio into their PayPal wallet, and purchase funds from almost any kind of online vendor with these funds. The transaction between PayPal and vendors often allows for a greater degree of trust, allowing for singular transactions consisting of many users’ payments between the two companies.

Additionally, the deposit of funds into a PayPal wallet can happen at the time of purchase, resulting in a system indistinguishable from pay-as-you-go.</p>

		  <br/>
          <p><b>Clash of Clans</p></b>

          <p>Clash of Clans is one of the most profitable mobile games in history. They use a prepaid system with a minimum purchase of 99 cents. Users buy proprietary currency that can be spent on upgrades. Clash of Clans exemplifies the predatory business practices mentioned in the Prepaid Systems section; nonlinear pricing schemes cause users to buy more than they want, in-game pricing schemes always ensure that users have currency left over, and feedback systems encourage users to buy currency impulsively. These practices are controversial, and have resulted in EU regulations. The US has not implemented similar regulations.</p>

	      <br/>
          <h3><b>Conclusion</h3></b>

          <hr/>

          <p>
          	Micropayment solutions attempt to address the fundamental problems faced by producers and consumers. Often this means abstracting the actual payment into more traditional methods, taking advantage of existing infrastructure while still providing the illusion of small and incremental payments to consumers.

Pay-as-you-go systems are almost non-existent. Until the issues defined <a href="#issues" style="display: inline">elsewhere</a> are addressed, micropayments will follow the model set by iTunes, PayPal, and online games like Clash of Clans.

          <p>This article discusses how micropayment services could be affected by the increased usage of cryptocurrencies, and specifically Bitcoin. As the usage of these currencies increases, payment service methods like micropayments need to adapt. It mainly outlines the present issues with transaction costs of bitcoin and how that makes micropayments with bitcoin very difficult. It also discusses several possible solutions for this problem such as different transaction logging methods.</p>

          <p>A viable implementation is crucial to a widespread adoption of micropayments systems. To get the details right, it is important to know what has not previously worked. This paper contextualizes the range of existing challenges for micropayments systems via discussion about deployment strategies and critical points of friction. Specifically, this paper considers implementation details in relation to usability, psychology, and economics, all of which have been neglected.</p>

          <p>Micropayment systems can now be a viable option due to a wealth of payment infrastructures, such as PayPal, Google Wallet, etc. Since micropayments empower users to pay small amounts of money as they consume content, it is important to consider micropayments’ effect on user behavior. This paper specifically examines the effects of micropayments on individuals’ selection and engagement with online journalism. Although it has a narrow scope, this paper highlights a potential issue between micropayments and online user behavior that could have broader social and economic effects.</p>
